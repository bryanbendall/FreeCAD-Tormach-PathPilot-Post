# FreeCAD-Tormach-Post

This is my version of a FreeCAD post processor for a Tormach Mill.

It is still very new and needs some testing, but it seems to be working good so far.

It is mostly a copy of the linuxcnc_post that is included with freecad but with some minor changes. Please look at the commits to see what has been changed.
